# Setup

Run all commands automatically. Only pause when user action is required.

**UX Note:** When asking the user questions, prefer using the `AskUserQuestion` tool instead of just outputting text. This integrates with Claude's built-in question/answer system for a better experience.

## Install Dependencies

```bash

```

## Test

Check the logs:
```bash

```

The user should receive a response in WhatsApp.

## Troubleshooting

```bash

```
