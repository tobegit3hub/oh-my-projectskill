# Content Context
Article title: on-my-projectskill: 让项目安装配置变成可执行的Agent Skill
Content summary: Introduces ProjectSkill, a concept that transforms project installation documentation into executable Agent Skills for Claude Code. It compares traditional approaches (README docs, shell scripts) with the AI-driven ProjectSkill approach that combines readability, executability, and interactivity. Uses NanoClaw as a reference implementation.
Keywords: Agent Skill, Claude Code, project setup, automation, environment detection, interactive decisions, NanoClaw, Markdown

# Text Elements
Title: "让项目安装配置变成可执行的Agent Skill"

# Mood Application
Use medium contrast, normal saturation, balanced visual weight.

# Font Application
Use clean geometric sans-serif typography. Modern, minimal letterforms.

# Composition
Type composition:
- Abstract shapes representing core concepts, information hierarchy, clean zones.
- Central conceptual visual with supporting elements.

Visual composition:
- Main visual: A stylized robot/agent figure in the center, holding or transforming a Markdown document into an executable gear/play-button symbol. The transformation metaphor — a static document becoming alive and actionable.
- Left side: A faded/dim stack representing old approaches — a document page with tiny text lines (README) and a terminal window (shell script), both slightly grayed out.
- Right side: The vibrant outcome — a glowing skill file with connected nodes (environment detection magnifying glass, chat bubble for interaction, branching arrows, checkmark for verification).
- Layout: Central focal point with the transformation visual, supporting elements radiating outward in a balanced composition.
- Decorative: Grid lines and geometric precision elements from the cool palette. Small dots, circuit-like connection lines, and technical schematic accents.

Color scheme:
- Primary: Engineering Blue (#2563EB) for main elements
- Secondary: Navy Blue (#1E3A5F) for depth and grounding
- Highlight: Cyan (#06B6D4) for the "active/living" elements and glow effects
- Background: Light Gray (#F8F9FA) clean base
- Accent: Amber (#F59E0B) for key interaction points and the transformation spark
- Supporting: Light Blue (#BFDBFE) for secondary fills

Rendering notes:
- Clean outlines with uniform stroke weight, closed shapes
- Flat color fills only — NO gradients, shadows, or noise
- Geometric icons and simple shapes
- Bold outlined objects with clean fills
- "Toy model" aesthetic: cute, rounded proportions
- Decorative dots, lines, small stars

Type notes:
- Abstract shapes representing core concepts
- Information hierarchy with clean zones
- Central metaphor visualization

Palette notes:
- Grid lines and alignment guides as subtle background elements
- Technical schematics and diagrams aesthetic
- Geometric precision elements
