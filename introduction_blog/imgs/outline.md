## Illustration 1

**Position**: After "每个项目都有一本'安装圣经'" section (after paragraph about docs vs scripts limitations)
**Purpose**: Visualize the pain point — the gap between documentation, scripts, and ideal setup experience
**Visual Content**: Three panels showing: (1) a developer overwhelmed by a long README doc, (2) a rigid shell script failing on an error, (3) a question mark representing the ideal solution. Icons for each approach with pain points labeled.
**Type Application**: infographic — presenting the problem space visually
**Filename**: 01-infographic-setup-pain-points.png

## Illustration 2

**Position**: After "什么是 ProjectSkill" section (after explaining core capabilities)
**Purpose**: Show the four core capabilities of ProjectSkill as a structured visual
**Visual Content**: Central "ProjectSkill" hub with four radiating capability nodes: 环境检测 (Environment Detection) with a magnifying glass icon, 交互决策 (Interactive Decisions) with a chat bubble icon, 条件分支 (Conditional Branching) with a fork-road icon, 验证反馈 (Verification Feedback) with a checkmark icon. Each node has a brief label.
**Type Application**: framework — showing the capability architecture

## Illustration 3

**Position**: After "参考NanoClaw设计" section (after the 9-step process description)
**Purpose**: Visualize the NanoClaw setup workflow as a step-by-step process with decision points
**Visual Content**: A flowchart showing the 9 setup steps as connected nodes. Decision points highlighted at steps involving user choices (container runtime, auth method, WhatsApp auth). Arrows show the flow, with branching paths at decision points. Agent and user icons at interaction points.
**Type Application**: flowchart — showing the setup process flow

## Illustration 4

**Position**: After "与传统方案的对比" section (replacing or complementing the table)
**Purpose**: Visually compare README docs, Shell scripts, and ProjectSkill across key dimensions
**Visual Content**: Three-column comparison with icons for each approach: README (document icon), Shell Script (terminal icon), ProjectSkill (robot/agent icon). Five comparison rows: 可执行性 (Executability), 交互能力 (Interactivity), 环境适应 (Environment Adaptation), 错误处理 (Error Handling), 维护成本 (Maintenance Cost). Use color coding: red/yellow/green to indicate capability levels.
**Type Application**: comparison — side-by-side feature comparison
