Setup Pain Points - Three Approaches Compared

Flat vector illustration infographic showing three approaches to project setup, each in its own panel.

Layout: Horizontal triptych with three equal panels side by side.

ZONES:
- Panel 1 (LEFT): A simplified developer figure sitting at a desk, looking overwhelmed. Above them floats a very long scrolling document labeled "README.md" with tiny unreadable text lines. A speech bubble shows "Step 1... Step 2... Step 9...". Red stress marks around the developer's head. Label below: "文档 Documentation" with subtitle "需要手动逐步执行" (Manual step-by-step execution required).
- Panel 2 (CENTER): A terminal window icon showing a shell script running. The script hits a red error line "ERROR: choice required" with a stop sign. The script cannot proceed because it needs user input but has no way to ask. Label below: "脚本 Shell Script" with subtitle "缺乏交互性" (Lacks interactivity).
- Panel 3 (RIGHT): A glowing question mark or lightbulb icon, surrounded by sparkles, suggesting there should be a better way. Three small icons orbit it: a document icon, a gear icon, and a chat bubble icon, suggesting the combination of readability + executability + interactivity. Label below: "理想方案?" with subtitle "可读 + 可执行 + 可交互" (Readable + Executable + Interactive).

LABELS: README.md, setup.sh, ERROR, 文档, 脚本, 理想方案?
COLORS: Cream background (#F5F0E6), Panel 1 uses Coral Red (#E07A5F) for stress, Panel 2 uses Mustard Yellow (#F2CC8F) for warning, Panel 3 uses Mint Green (#81B29A) for the positive solution hint. Black outlines on all elements.
ELEMENTS: Geometric simplified icons, no gradients, playful decorative elements (dots, stars). Human figures as simplified stylized silhouettes, not photorealistic.
STYLE: Clean flat vector art with bold shapes and black outlines. Modern tech illustration style.

Clean composition with generous white space. Simple cream background. Main elements centered in each panel.
Text should be large and prominent with handwritten-style fonts. Keep minimal, focus on keywords. Text in Chinese.
